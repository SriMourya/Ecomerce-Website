# Ecomerce-Website
A minimalist online-store application built with Spring Boot 6, JPA, and an in-memory H2 database on the back end, and a React JS single-page interface on the front end. The project shows how to create, list, and serve product data (including images) through REST APIs and display it in a responsive UI.
